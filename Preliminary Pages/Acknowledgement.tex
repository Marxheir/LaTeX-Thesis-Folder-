I extend my sincere gratitude to those who have been instrumental in my academic journey, especially in the successful completion of this thesis. I am deeply thankful to my two supervisors, Prof Axel Weber (first supervisor) and Prof Hagemejer (second supervisor), for their unwavering support, insightful comments, and valuable feedback. Their guidance not only strengthened my courage but also facilitated the timely completion of this thesis. 


I am equally thankful to the entire staff of the Department of Social Policy and Social Security Studies. Particularly, I am appreciate Prof. Hellsmuller Simona, the current head of the M.Sc. in Social Protection programme, for her mentoring all through the course of this master programme. Special acknowledgment goes to the in-house DAAD advisor, Mr Abdulraman, and the thesis coordinator, Mr Brian, for their support and openness.

 

My gratitude extends to the HBRS university writing center, particularly to Prof Yates Jill, for her tenacious support and insightful comments despite a demanding schedule. I must acknowledge Mrs Christiana Loewe for her encouraging words during the challenging phases of this journey. Your collective contributions have been invaluable, and I am deeply thankful for the rewarding experiences gained through our interactions
