	abstract = {A seminal work in health economics first published in 1972, Michael Grossman's The Demand for Health introduced a new theoretical model for determining the health status of the population. His work uniquely synthesized economic and public health knowledge and has catalyzed a vastly influential body of health economics literature. It is well past time to bring this important work back into print. Grossman bases his approach on Gary S. Becker's household production function model and his theory of investment in human capital. Consumers demand health, which can include illness-free days in a given year or life expectancy, and then produce it through the input of medical care services, diet, other market goods and services, and time. Grossman also treats health and knowledge as equal parts of the durable stock of human capital. Consumers therefore have an incentive to invest in health to increase their earnings in the future. From here, Grossman examines complementarities between health capital and other forms of human capital, the most important of which is knowledge capital earned through schooling and its effect on the efficiency of production. He concludes that the rate of return on investing in health by increasing education may exceed the rate of return on investing in health through greater medical care. Higher income may not lead to better health outcomes, as wealth enables the consumption of goods and services with adverse health effects. These are some of the major revelations of Grossman's model, findings that have great relevance as we struggle to understand the links between poverty, education, structural disadvantages, and health.},

This paper analyses the underlying discourses of {UK} and Sweden’s foreign aid strategies. Dryzek’s discourse analysis model was used in this paper to assess the respective aid strategies of the {UK} and Sweden and describe how foreign aid actors view and understand developmental issues. Foreign aid strategies have been applied to various development contexts such as economic growth, basic needs, human capabilities, and the goal achievement like the Millennium Development Goals and the current Sustainable Development Goals. Additionally, geostrategic, economical, and political factors orientate aid strategies. The comparison between aid strategies of the {UK} and Sweden shows that the {UK} and Swedish discourses emphasise on democratic states and individuals as key factors for a sustain development in recipient countries. Their discourses, however, differ in their approach to effectiveness of aid and the conditions they use around aid.},

	abstract = {Background: The Global Fund to Fight {AIDS}, Tuberculosis and Malaria has proven highly effective at fighting the world’s major killers. Strong governance and robust development institutions are necessary, however, for improving health long-term. While some suggest that international aid can strengthen institutions, others worry that aid funding will undermine governance, creating long-term harm. The Global Fund is a unique aid institution with mechanisms designed to improve transparency and accountability, but the effectiveness of this architecture is not clear.
Objectives: This study seeks evidence on the effects of Fund financing over the past 15 years on national governance and development.
Methods: A unique dataset from 112 low- and middle-income countries was constructed with data from 2003 to 2017 on Global Fund financing and multiple measures of health, development, and governance. Building a set of regression models, we estimate the relationship between Fund financing and key indicators of good governance and development, controlling for multiple factors, including the effects of other aid programs and tests for reverse causality. Findings: We find that Global Fund support is associated with improved control of corruption, government accountability, political freedoms, regulatory quality, and rule of law, though association with effective policy implementation is less clear. We also find associated benefit for overall adult mortality and human development.
Conclusion: Our data are not consistent with recent claims that aid undermines governance. Instead our findings support the proposition that the Global Fund architecture is making it possible to address the continuing crises of {AIDS}, tuberculosis, and malaria in ways that improve institutions, fight corruption, and support development. Amidst the complex political economy that produces good governance at a national level, our finding of a beneficial effect of health aid suggests important lessons for aid in other settings.},

This paper examined whether foreign aid (total foreign aid and health sector aid) has been effective in improving the health of citizens in recipient nations since establishment of the {MDGs}. Five facets of population health were examined: infant mortality, life expectancy, the annual death rate, and immunizations against measles and diphtheria. Using a panel data set covering 90 developing countries, observed annually over 2001–2015, fixed-effects multivariate regressions with alternative specifications were estimated for each of these measures. The findings reveal that foreign aid has had little to no effect on population health since 2000. We found some evidence that foreign aid has improved life expectancy in developing countries, however, the effect is very small. In light of these findings, continued monitoring of the relationship between foreign aid and health outcomes would be both valuable and prudent.},

	volume = {20},
	doi = {10.1186/s12961-022-00859-6},
	abstract = {Background
Several countries allocate official development assistance ({ODA}) for research on global health and development issues that is initiated in the donor country. The integration of such research within domestic research systems aligns with efforts to coordinate {ODA} investments with science, technology and innovation policies towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals ({SDGs}).

Methods
Through a document synthesis and interviews with research funders in {ODA} donor and recipient countries, we evaluated the performance of this funding approach across seven donor-country programmes from five donor countries and examined the institutional design elements that increase its chances of advancing development goals and addressing global challenges.

Results
We found that carefully designed programmes provide a promising pathway to producing valuable and contextually relevant knowledge on global health and development issues. To achieve these outcomes and ensure they benefit {ODA}-receiving countries, programmes should focus on recipient-country priorities and absorptive capacity; translate research on global public goods into context-appropriate technologies; plan and monitor pathways to impact; structure equitable partnerships; strengthen individual and institutional capacity; and emphasize knowledge mobilization.

Conclusions
Global health and development research programmes and partnerships have an important role to play in achieving the {SDGs} and addressing global challenges. Governments should consider the potential of {ODA}-funded research programmes to address gaps in their global health and development frameworks. In the absence of concrete evidence of development impact, donor countries should consider making increases in {ODA} allocations for research additional to more direct investments that have demonstrated effectiveness in {ODA}-receiving countries.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the link between foreign aid for family planning services and a broad set of health outcomes. More specifically, it documents the harmful effects of the so-called “Mexico City Policy” ({MCP}), which restricts {US} funding for nongovernmental organizations that provide abortion-related services abroad. First enacted in 1985, the {MCP} is implemented along partisan lines; it is enforced only when a Republican administration is in office and quickly rescinded when a Democrat wins the presidency. Although previous research has shown that {MCP} causes significant disruption to family planning programs worldwide, its consequences for health outcomes, such as mortality and {HIV} rates, remain underexplored. The independence of the {MCP}’s implementation from the situation in recipient countries allows us to systematically study its impact. Using country-level data from 134 countries between 1990 and 2015, we first show that the {MCP} is associated with higher maternal and child mortality and {HIV} incidence rates. These effects are magnified by dependence on {US} aid while mitigated by funds from non-{US} donors. Next, we complement these results using individual-level data from 30 low- and middle-income countries and show that, under the {MCP}, women have less access to modern contraception and are less exposed to information on family planning and {AIDS} via in-person channels. Moreover, pregnant women are more likely to report that their pregnancy is not desired. Our findings highlight the importance of mitigating the harmful effects of {MCP} by redesigning or counteracting this policy.},

	abstract = {Objective Cross-national studies provide inconclusive results as to the effectiveness of foreign health aid. We highlight a novel application of using subnational data to evaluate aid impacts, using Malawi as a case study.
Design We employ two rounds of nationally representative household surveys (2004/2005 and 2010/2011) and geo-referenced foreign aid data. We examine the determinants of Malawi's traditional authorities receiving aid according to health, environmental risk, socioeconomic and political factors. We use two approaches to estimate the impact of aid on reducing malaria prevalence and increasing healthcare quality: difference-in-difference models, which include traditional authority and month-of-interview fixed effects and control for individual and household level time-varying factors, and entropy balancing, where models balance on health-related and socioeconomic baseline characteristics. General health aid and four specific health aid sectors are examined.
Results Traditional authorities with greater proportions of individuals living in urban areas, more health facilities and greater proportions of those in major ethnic groups were more likely to receive aid. Difference-in-difference models show health infrastructure and parasitic disease control aid reduced malaria prevalence by 1.20 (95\% {CI} −0.36 to 2.76) and 2.20 (95\% {CI} 0.43 to 3.96) percentage points, respectively, and increased the likelihood of individuals reporting healthcare as more than adequate by 12.1 (95\% {CI} 1.51 to 22.68) and 14.0 (95\% {CI} 0.11 to 28.11) percentage points. Entropy balancing shows similar results.
Conclusions Aid was targeted to areas with greater existing health infrastructure rather than areas most in need, but still effectively reduced malaria prevalence and enhanced self-reported healthcare quality.},

This paper combines household panel data with geographically referenced subnational foreign aid data to investigate the contribution of health aid to health outcomes in Uganda. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we find that aid had a strong effect on reducing the productivity burden of disease indicated by days of productivity lost due to illness but was less effective in reducing disease prevalence. Consequently, health aid appeared to primarily quicken recovery times rather than prevent disease. In addition, we find that health aid was most beneficial to individuals who lived closest to aid projects. Apart from the impact of aid, we find that aid tended to not be targeted to localities with the worse socioeconomic conditions. Overall, the results highlight the importance of allocating aid close to subnational areas with greater need to enhance aid effectiveness.},

The uncertainty of whether an aid will deliver results brought about the current strategy of disbursing funds directly to governments in {LDCs}. The goals behind foreign aid has undergone something of a shift, in its quantities and the way it is spent, since early 2000s. This study examine whether foreign aid for health affects the health outcomes in Nigeria and whether other factors, such as the level of transparency of the institutions, are important determinants of health outcomes in the Country. The study used {ARDL} econometric model to assess the said pattern of relationship and roles. The study findings indicated that foreign aid for health improve health outcomes in Nigeria in both short and long run. It also found that key governance indicators such as, Government Effectiveness, Control of Corruption, Accountability and Voice, Rule of Law, quality of regulation, play a vital role in improving the health outcome of under-five mortality as they tend to reduce it. Furthermore, the study recommends that: Donor agencies should direct health aid to specific health target like reducing under-five mortality rate than taking several health issues at a go. Government at all levels should uphold virtues of good governance as it affects the effectiveness of health aids directed to the country’s health sector by donor agencies.},

	abstract = {Inflows of foreign aid to developing countries have increased while health outcomes are significantly low compared to other countries of the world. Therefore, there is a debate whether foreign aid contributes to improvement in health outcome in the literature. This research examines the impact of foreign aids, economic growth on health outcome in Nigeria using data from 1981 to 2019. Using the Auto Regressive Distributive Lag ({ARDL}) and Toda-Yamamoto techniques, the study examines the impact of government expenditure on health, economic growth and other development assistance on life expectancy. Data from World Development Indicators and Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin were used. Official Development Assistance ({ODA}) showed a positive but not significant impact on life expectancy rate in Nigeria while government expenditure on health showed a positive and significant relationship, economic growth showed a non-significant relationship. The result from Toda-Yamamoto technique shows that there is a unidirectional causality running from foreign aids to life expectancy. The causal feedback relationship between life expectancy and government expenditure on health implies that increase in government spending on health facilities can lead to an improvement in life expectancy in Nigeria. Also, an improvement in health quality or life expectancy may increase the population which will in turn force the government to increase health spending so as to care for the citizens, especially the aging population. No evidence of directional causality between life expectancy and economic growth. Meanwhile, there is a one-way causality flowing from life expectancy to exchange rate in Nigeria. The research concluded that foreign aid is not effective in improving health outcome in Nigeria. The research recommended that government should increase her spending on health to improve the overall health outcome in Nigeria.},

The study therefore assessed the effect of health aid on life expectancy using data on 46 {SSA} countries from 2000 to 2019 which were sourced from the World Development Indicator, Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Creditor Reporting System, and United Nations Children’s Fund. System Generalized Method of Moment (system {GMM}) was adopted in analyzing the data due to its appropriateness for the scenario at hand. Validity of the model was examined with autoregressive ({AR}) tests ({AR}(1) and {AR}(2)), while Sargan test and Hansen test assessed the validity of the instruments used in the estimation. Robustness of the system {GMM} was confirmed using the pooled Ordinary Least Square and fixed effect regressions. Results showed that health aid does not have any significant effect on life expectancy in {SSA}. Rather, life expectancy was significantly improved by school enrolment, trade openness, Gross Domestic Product per capita and physician density, while corruption significantly reduced it. The study recommended more judicious utilization of official development assistance meant for the health sector, policies capable of achieving noticeable growth and development, and improved effort to eradicate corruption in government policy implementation in the health sector to significantly improve life expectancy in the region.},

Therefore, we conducted a literature review on relevant international organizations with respect to this topic. We found that many international organizations consider the wide range of social protection services, including social insurance and social assistance, essential for achieving {UHC} in 2030. In specific health programs, social protection is considered an important service to promote health service access and financial protection, especially among vulnerable populations. However, discussions about social protection for achieving {UHC} are not given high priority in the World Health Organization. Currently, the coverage of social protection services is low among vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries. To address this issue, we employed the metrics recommended by the migrant integration policy index ({MIPEX}). Based on our findings, a conceptual framework was developed.

	abstract = {Abstract: This study conducts an international comparative analysis of the recent evolution of social protection systems in sub-Saharan Africa ({SSA}), Latin America and the Caribbean ({LAC}), and Asia-Pacific ({APAC}) regions, paying particular attention to the role of foreign aid in these dynamics. It asks: Has foreign aid contributed to the development of social protection systems? If so, what actors have driven this process? What modalities and financial instruments have been used to support social protection systems? What other factors have contributed to the recent evolution of social protection systems? To address these questions, we implement Tobit models with endogenous regressors ({IV}-Tobit), and fractional response models with endogenous regressors ({FRM}). Overall, we find that aid has contributed to the expansion of social protection systems in the Global South: an increase in social protection aid by one percentage point is estimated to lead to an increase in the share of countries’ population covered by social protection by approximately 0.25 per cent, which is not negligible. The analysis also identifies key factors that have underpinned the recent expansion of social protection systems, including the economic dynamism of aid-recipient countries, their redistributive fiscal capacity, their insertion into the global economy, and their level of income inequality. Donors’ influence and policy diffusion seem to contribute to the expansion of social protection in some regions, particularly {LAC} and {APAC}, but not in {SSA}. The paper provides a discussion of plausible reasons underpinning these differences.},

So, this work aims to analyze the impact of {FDI} on welfare measured through the human development index and its three dimensions (education, life expectancy, and income). Based on a sample of 146 countries for the period 2002–2019, the results obtained by two-staged least squares-instrumental variable estimation suggest that {FDI} impact on social welfare depends on the countries’ human capital which reflects countries’ absorptive capacity. Results also highlight the role of government expenses in consumption, political stability, and quality of technological infrastructures. Therefore, the results suggest that, in order to improve social welfare, countries should focus and gear their policies towards fostering the improvement of their human resources, political stability, and technological infrastructures.},

The data, however, show evidence to the contrary that aid causes small reductions in inequality. The findings are similar to those in recent studies on the topic. We have also found that trade and the share of population under the age of 15 worsen inequality.},

	abstract = {In the new millennium, the Western aid effort toward Africa has surged due to writings by well-known economists, a celebrity mass advocacy campaign, and decisions by Western leaders to make Africa a major foreign policy priority. This survey contrasts the predominant “transformational” approach (West comprehensively saves Africa) to occasional swings to a “marginal” approach (West takes one small step at a time to help individual Africans). Evaluation of “one step at a time” initiatives is generally easier than that of transformational ones either through controlled experiments (although these have been oversold) or simple case studies where it is easier to attribute outcomes to actions. We see two themes emerge from the literature survey: (1) escalation—as each successive Western transformational effort has yielded disappointing results (as judged at least by stylized facts, since again the econometrics are shaky), the response has been to try an even more ambitious effort and (2) the cycle of ideas—rather than a progressive testing and discarding of failed ideas, we see a cycle in aid ideas in many areas in Africa, with ideas going out of fashion only to come back again later after some lapse long enough to forget the previous disappointing experience. Both escalation and cyclicality of ideas are symptomatic of the lack of learning that seems to be characteristic of the “transformational” approach. In contrast, the “marginal” approach has had some successes in improving the well-being of individual Africans, such as the dramatic fall in mortality.},

	abstract = {The {OECD}'s Development Assistance Committee ({DAC}) has compiled foreign aid statistics since the 1960s, and it invented the concept of Official Development Assistance ({ODA}) in 1969. For decades, {ODA} data were on actual flows, the {DAC} having rejected suggestions commencing in 1963 to instead focus on flows' "grant equivalents". But in 2014 the {DAC} decided, from 2018, to switch {ODA} loan reporting to "grant equivalents" using unrealistic parameters that exaggerated donors' fiscal effort. In 2016 it decided to abandon the requirement that all {ODA} transactions be concessional. By 2018, having failed to agree grant equivalent methodology for equity investments, loans to the private sector, and debt relief, it decided to maintain reporting of these on a flow basis. {ODA} therefore now mixes flows and grant equivalents, which are incommensurable statistical quantities, and embodies other contradictions and anomalies. This paper examines the degradation of the {ODA} measure and identifies general lessons for statistical development exercises and quality control efforts.},

In particular, a constant increase in the share of aid‐financed global public goods and a shift towards weighted‐sum and weakest‐link global goods are observed. Economic conditions, imitation effects, global engagement and domestic spending result as the main drivers of donors’ demand for aid‐financed global public goods. Besides, a certain complementarity in the provision of global goods plays a role, especially in European countries and Japan, partially easing the prognosis for the collective action problems related to global goods},

              {ILC}
              ) adopted a Resolution and Conclusions setting out the Organization's new social security strategy, which aims at supporting Members in building and maintaining comprehensive social security systems on the basis of a two‐dimensional approach: (1) (“horizontal” dimension) establishing – as a priority – nationally‐defined sets of basic social security guarantees to provide a floor of protection to all in need as soon as possible; (2) (“vertical” dimension) extending the scope and levels of social security coverage as guided by Convention No. 102 (1952) and other existing social security standards to as many people as possible and as soon as possible. In
              J
              une 2012, the
              {ILC}
              completed this strategy with a new international labour standard: Recommendation concerning national floors of social protection, 2012 (No. 202). The Recommendation is deemed a breakthrough in global social policy, whereby the establishing of national social protection floors may close prevailing gaps in social security coverage and help countries to effectively address poverty and vulnerability. This special double issue offers analysis of the process that culminated in the Recommendation's adoption and addresses practical fiscal, legal, political and institutional challenges that must be addressed if the Recommendation's goals are to be successfully implemented.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The Ghana National Health Insurance Scheme ({NHIS}) was established in 2003, Act, 2003 (Act 650), but was later replaced with the National Health Insurance Act, 2012 (Act 852) to get rid of the then “cash and carry” system of paying for healthcare. The aim of the scheme was to reduce the cost of healthcare provision and increase access to healthcare. This paper investigates the effect of the National Health Insurance Scheme ({NHIS}) on healthcare utilization and out-of-pocket payment, from the providers’ perspective. The study uses data from the seventh round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey ({GLSS} 7) conducted in 2016/2017 and employs the estimation method of Propensity Score Matching ({PSM}). The findings are that enrollment onto Ghana’s National Health Insurance Scheme ({NHIS}) increases healthcare utilization by 26\% and decreases out-of-pocket payment by 4\%. However, about 48\% of the population are still not enrolled, citing various reasons. Even those who enrolled, about 30\% had dropped out for several reasons. The study identifies age, income, education, sex, and location of residence as the main determinants of enrolling onto the {NHIS}. I show that the National Health Insurance Scheme increases healthcare utilization and reduces out-of-pocket payment in Ghana. A number of Ghanaians have either not registered or registered but have stopped enrolling citing no money, no need for {NHIS}, and no confidence in the system’ as reasons. Any policy to invigorate the public confidence in {NHIS} and increases enrollment should be targeted at the young, poor, less educated, males, and rural dwellers.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Fees charged at the point of use are a barrier to the health services’ users, especially for the poorest. Two decades ago, Cambodia introduced the so-called health equity fund ({HEF}) strategy, a waiver scheme which enhances access to public health services for the poor without undermining the economic situation of facilities. Evidence suggests that hospital-based {HEF} effectively removed financial barriers and reduced out-of-pocket expenditures. There is less evidence on the effectiveness of the {HEF} when assistance is extended to the primary level of healthcare. This research explores the impact of a {HEF} extended to health centres in two rural health districts. Two household surveys and 16-month diary data allowed to assess the impact of the intervention on health-seeking behaviours and expenditure of poor households. Though {HEF} effectively removed user fees at public health facilities, health centre utilization of sick and poor people did not budge much in the intervention district; self-medication and private provider consultations remained the preferred health-seeking behaviours, by far, even if more expensive. Difference-in-difference estimates confirmed that {HEF} had a slight impact on health-seeking behaviours, but only for the subgroups of {HEF} beneficiaries living close to the health centre and ready to test their new entitlement. This research reminds on the importance of the context for the effectiveness of any policy: in a highly pluralistic health sector, waiving already low-user fees in public health centres may be insufficient to increase rapidly the use of those facilities and reduce catastrophic spending. In such context, apart from distance to health centres, perceived quality of services at the health centres, which was relatively low compared with other providers, also matters. Although the {HEF} scheme plays a role in improving perceived and objective quality of care, complementary means are to be deployed.},

            We analyze short-term effects of free hospitalization insurance for the poorest quintile of the population in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. First, we exploit that eligibility is based on an exogenous poverty score threshold and apply a regression discontinuity design. Second, we exploit imperfect rollout and compare insured and uninsured households using propensity score matching. With both methods we fail to detect significant effects on the incidence of hospitalization. Whereas the program did not meaningfully increase the quantity of health care consumed, insured households more often choose private hospitals, indicating a shift towards higher perceived quality of care.},

	abstract = {Background
              . In recent years, health insurance ({HI}) has been chosen by many low- and middle-income countries to obtain an important health policy target—universal health coverage. Vietnam has recently introduced the Revised Health Insurance Law, and the effects of the voluntary health insurance ({VHI}) and heavily subsidised health insurance ({HSHI}) programmes have not yet been analysed. Therefore, this study is aimed at examining the impact of these {HI} programmes on the utilisation of health care services and out-of-pocket health expenditure ({OOP}) in general and across different health care providers in particular.
              Methods
              . Using the two waves of Vietnam Household Living Standard Surveys 2014 and 2016 and the difference-in-difference method, the impacts of {VHI} and {HSHI} on health care utilisation and {OOP} in Vietnam were estimated.
              Results
              . For both the {VHI} and {HSHI} groups, we found that {HI} increased the probability of seeking outpatient care, the mean number of outpatient visits, the total number of visits, and the mean number of visits at the district level of health care providers in the last 12 months. However, there was no evidence that the {HSHI} programmes increased the mean number of inpatient visits and the number of visits at the provincial hospital. We also found that while the {VHI} programme reduced {OOP} for both outpatient and inpatient care, the {HSHI} scheme did not result in a reduction in {OOP} for hospitalisation, although {HI} lowered the total {OOP}. Similarly, we found that for both groups, {HI} reduced {OOP} when the insured visited district and provincial hospitals. However, the statistically significant impact was not demonstrated when the enrolees of {HSHI} programmes visited provincial hospitals.
              Conclusion
              . The study offers evidence that the Vietnamese {HI} scheme increased health care service utilisation and decreased {OOP} for the participants of the {VHI} and {HSHI} programmes. Therefore, the government should continue to consider improving the {HI} system as a strategy to achieve universal health coverage.},

This present study investigates whether or not aid has produced the anticipated results in 12 selected {SADC} countries using panel data analysis covering a period of nine years (2005-2013). The variable of choice for measuring aid effectiveness in reducing poverty in this present study is the human development index ({HDI}), a non-monetary poverty measure. Overally, the study finds that aid has a negative and no significant impact on poverty reduction, supporting the works of the public choice hypothesis. The negative and insignificant results could be explained by aid misallocation, misuse and lack of absorptive capacity by recipient countries. Secondly for the analysis of how aid can be made more effective in reducing poverty, empirical evidence suggests that institutional quality, control of corruption and trade openness are vital for aid effectiveness. Economic growth and trade openness have been found to be necessary conditions for poverty reduction. ii {ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}},

	shorttitle = {Toward a conceptual framework of health and its operational definition},
	abstract = {Background
Defining and measuring Health presents a challenge, partly due to its conceptual pluralism. To measure Health as an ability to adapt and self-manage, we developed an approach within the theoretical framework of resources and reserves over the life course, recently proposed in the literature. We aimed to (i) use the conceptual framework developed to identify indicators of deteriorating health reserves, (ii) construct an overall health measure from these indicators, (iii) evaluate the association between the overall health measure and subsequent health outcomes and (iv) assess the robustness of our method.

Methods
We used data from 7,043 individuals born in 1958 in Great Britain included in the National Child Development Study. An overall health measure was constructed via the sum of three selected indicators of deteriorating health reserves in mid-life: chronic widespread pain ({CWP}), Clinical Interview Schedule - revised ({CIS}-r), and allostatic load ({AL}). A three-category variable was defined: impaired/medium/optimal overall health. We explored criterion validity by modelling the relationships between the overall health measure, or each reserve taken separately at 44–45 years, and self-rated health at 46 years and mortality up to 58 years, corresponding to 14 years of follow up, using Cox and logistic regressions respectively. We performed comparative analyses to assess the robustness of the method.

Results
Having an impaired overall health measure was significantly associated with all-cause premature mortality ({HRimpaired} = 2.74 [1.86; 4.05]) and an increased risk of later fair/poor/very poor self-rated health ({ORimpaired} = 7.50 [6.29; 8.95]). The overall health measure had a greater effect on the self-rated health estimates than each indicator of deteriorating health reserves considered separately ({ORAL} medium = 1.82 [1.59; 2.09]; {ORAL} high = 2.74 [2.37; 3.16]; {ORCIS}-r = 5.20 [4.45; 6.08]; {ORCWP} = 2.85 [2.53; 3.21]). {CIS}-r and allostatic load were also associated with premature mortality contrary to chronic widespread pain ({HRAL} medium1.82 [1.27; 2.61]; {HRAL} high = 3.10 [2.19; 4.40]; {HRCIS}-r = 1.77 [1.22; 2.56]; {HRCWP} = 1.32 [0.98; 1.76]). The multiple comparative analyses conducted allowed us to assess the robustness of our method within this cohort.

Conclusions
We proposed a method for measuring Health in mid-life in line with the concept of Health as the ability to adapt and self-manage and the concept of health reserves. This method may be applied and further developed within the field of social and positive epidemiology.

The concept repositions the traditional areas of Social Protection (labor market intervention, social insurance and social safety nets) in a framework that includes three strategies to deal with risk (prevention, mitigation and coping), three levels of formality of risk management (informal, market-based, public) and many actors (individuals, households, communities, {NGOs}, governments at various levels and international organizations) against the background of asymmetric information and different types of risk. This expanded view of Social Protection emphasizes the double role of risk management instruments—protecting basic livelihood as well as promoting risk taking. It focuses specifically on the poor since they are the most vulnerable to risk and typically lack appropriate risk management instruments, which constrains them from engaging in riskier but also higher return activities and hence gradually moving out of chronic poverty.},

In the World Development Report 1990, for example, safety nets were very much the third prong of the World Bank’s three-pronged approach to ‘attacking poverty’ (World Bank, 1990), and were conceptualized as minimalist social assistance in countries too poor and too administratively weak to introduce comprehensive social welfare programmes. During the 1990s, as new thinking emerged in areas such as ‘rights-based approaches’, ‘sustainable livelihoods’, and the multidimensional nature of poverty and vulnerability, safety nets began to be criticized as residualist and paternalistic, and more sophisticated alternatives began to be proposed. As this agenda has evolved, the broader potential of social protection began to be recognized, and bigger claims are now being made for what social protection can and should strive to achieve.},

	abstract = {Social assistance is a means-tested benefit that is supposed to be a short-term, temporary economic support. Understanding why some individuals are in repeated or continuous need of social assistance is thus of obvious policy relevance, but the dynamics of social assistance receipt remain poorly understood. In 2005, a survey among long-term recipients of social assistance in Norway collected data on (a) childhood disadvantages, (b) health status, (c) health behaviors, (d) psychological resources, and (e) social ties, in addition to basic sociodemographic information. This rich survey data has been linked with tax register data from 2005–2013, enabling us to explore the detailed characteristics of long-term social assistance recipients who are unable to reach financial self-sufficiency. Results from linear probability models show that surprisingly few of the 28 explanatory variables are statistically associated with social assistance dynamics, with two important exceptions: People with drug problems and immigrants both have a much higher probability of social assistance receipt. Yet overall, it is challenging to ‘predict’ social assistance dynamics, indicating that randomness most likely plays a non-negligible role. The 28 explanatory variables do a far better job in predicting both labor market success (employment), labor market preparation (work assessment allowance), and labor market withdrawal (disability benefit utilization). Thus, there seems to be something distinctive about the processes leading to continued social assistance recipiency, where randomness could be a more influential force.},

	abstract = {This study examines foreign aid effectiveness in poverty reduction in Africa with focus on the role of regional fiscal policy on education and health. The study employs panel dynamic ordinary least squares ({DOLS}) estimation technique and covers the period 1980-2017. The results reveal that foreign aid augmented with effective fiscal policy on education significantly improves the income level in all the regions except Central Africa, and consumption in the Western and Central regions. When augmented with effective fiscal policy on health foreign aid enhances households’ income in West and Central Africa and consumption in West and Southern regions. Furthermore, foreign aid augmented with effective fiscal policy in education (health) reduces poverty headcount in the West and Central (in all regions except Central) regions of Africa. The study concludes that foreign aid augmented with fiscal policy on education improves income in all regions except Central Africa; and West and East Africa when augmented with health expenditure. To sustain the effectiveness of foreign aid in Africa there is the need to improve governments’ allocation to the health and education sectors to deepen households’ income.},

	abstract = {Worldwide countries are recognising the need for and significance of universal health coverage ({UHC}); however, health inequality continues to persist. This study evaluates the status and equity of residents’ demand for and utilisation of health services and expenditure by considering the three components of universal health coverage, urban-rural differences, and different income groups. Sample data from China’s Fifth Health Service Survey were analysed and the ‘five levels of income classification’ were used to classify people into income groups. This study used descriptive analysis and concentration index and concentration curve for equity evaluation. Statistically significant differences were found in the demand and utilisation of health services between urban and rural residents. Rural residents’ demand and utilisation of health services decreased with an increase in income and their health expenditure was higher than that of urban residents. Compared with middle- and high-income rural residents, middle- and lower-income rural residents faced higher hospitalisation expenses; and, compared with urban residents, equity in rural residents’ demand and utilisation of health services, and annual health and hospitalisation expenditures, were poorer. Thus, equity of health service utilisation and expenditure for urban and rural residents with different incomes remain problematic, requiring improved access and health policies.},

            Why do richer countries spend a higher share of their income on social protection than poor countries? A newly assembled dataset on social protection spending for 142 countries since 1995 allows an exploration of alternate hypotheses, treating the pandemic period separately, as it entailed a large expansion in social protection efforts. While the mean income share devoted to social protection rises with income, this is attributable to multiple confounders, including relative prices, weak governance in low-income countries, and access to information-communication technologies. Controlling for these, social protection spending is similar between rich and poor countries. This was also true during the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Official development assistance ({ODA}) is defined as government aid designed to promote the economic development and welfare of developing countries. Loans and credits for military purposes are excluded. 
               Aid may be provided bilaterally, from donor to recipient, or channelled through a multilateral development agency such as the United Nations or the World Bank. Aid includes grants, "soft" loans and the provision of technical assistance.
               The {OECD} maintains a list of developing countries and territories; only aid to these countries counts as {ODA}. The list is periodically updated and currently contains over 150 countries or territories (see {DAC} List of {ODA} Recipients: https://oe.cd/dac-list ).
               A long-standing United Nations target is that developed countries should devote 0.7\% of their gross national income to {ODA}. 
               Prior to 2018, the {ODA} flows basis methodology covered loans expressed on a “cash basis”, meaning their full face value was included, then repayments were subtracted as they came in. From 2018, the {ODA} grant-equivalent methodology is used whereby only the “grant portion” of the loan, i.e. the amount “given” by lending below market rates, counts as {ODA}. 
               This indicator is measured as a percentage of gross national income and million {USD} constant prices, using 2021 as the base year.},
